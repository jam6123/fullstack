It is normal that your fetch api is run twice inside useEffect, you know the react's strict mode causing that.

All 4XX status codes are still successful request but the intended request was fail.

A "CSRF attack" is often referred to as a “one-way” attack, as attackers can access and manipulate HTTP requests but cannot access the responses data.

A CSRF token is meant to protect state changing routes, so it's okay if there's no csrf protection on GET routes unless it also do some mutation.

Use useReducer when the state handling gets complex, not when the amount of variables increases. For example when different state variables rely on each other.

To avoid database call on every client request just to check the user's session for example, you can store session in redis instead.
